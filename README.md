# NonlinearPreprocess_ANN_HashAlgorithm
This source codes demonstrate my paper "One-way Character Sequence Hash Algorithm Based on Nonlinear Preprocess and Recurrent Neural Network". You can download it and run on your machine using MATLAB.

This paper proposed a novel hash algorithm for one-way character sequence based on the nonlinear preprocess and recurrent neural network. The algorithm firstly obtained the target numerical sequence after the original character sequence is nonlinearly processed, and then the target numerical sequence will be input to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for computation of the final hash code. Theoretical analysis and experiment demonstrated that the method we proposed had excellent properties of initial sensitivity, chaos diffusion, anti-collision ability and one-way nature, thus showed good research and application significances.


Have Fun!
